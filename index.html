<h1>Classic Fortress</h1>
<h2>Team Fortress like it used to be</h2>
<p><em>Classic Fortress</em> is a complete Team Fortress solution. Every aspect of the game is controlled by the authors to make the experience authentic yet polished. By controlling the client, server and qwprogs (modification code) as well as the packaging, every detail can be tailored for the purpose of making this classic game accessible to anyone. The aim of the project is to add functionality and ease of use to the classic Team Fortress modification without affecting gameplay. Please note that <em>this is not TFC</em>. The original Team Fortress was a modification to Quake (1), which this project is based on.</p>
